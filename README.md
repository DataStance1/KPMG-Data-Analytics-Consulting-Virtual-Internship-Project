# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Consulting-Virtual-Internship-Project
This repository contains the project for the KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship
#
In this project, I was tasked with consulting for a firm. I was given the messy company data and was told to identify the best type of customers for SPOCKET CENTRAL to target in her marketing campaigns.
#
* The data was loaded into Excel
* Preliminary data assessment and cleaning were performed
* The Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) analysis was done and used to identify the best customers to target
* A summary dashboard representing key findings was built in Tableau
